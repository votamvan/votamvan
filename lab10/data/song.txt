I once wrote a program that wouldn't compile
I don't know why it wouldn't compile,
My TA just smiled.

My program did nothing
So I started typing.
I added System.out.println("I <3 coding"),
I don't know why it wouldn't compile,
My TA just smiled.

"Parse error," cried the compiler
Luckily I'm such a code baller.
I added a backslash to escape the quotes,
I added System.out.println("I <3 coding"),
I don't know why it wouldn't compile,
My TA just smiled.

Now the compiler wanted an identifier
And I thought the situation was getting dire.
I added a main method with its String[] args,
I added a backslash to escape the quotes,
I added System.out.println("I <3 coding"),
I don't know why it wouldn't compile,
My TA just smiled.

Java complained it expected an enum
Boy, these computers really are dumb!
I added a public class and called it Scum,
I added a main method with its String[] args,
I added a backslash to escape the quotes,
I added System.out.println("I <3 coding"),
I don't know why it wouldn't compile,
My TA just smiled.
